# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will prepare your environment by installing the necessary browser extensions and accessing the SAP system for the first time.

## Open GitHub Repository in Edge Browser

This is needed to seperate the instructions from the recording. It will make life easier then.

## Install Browser Extension

Tosca Cloud needs browser extensions to automate the following browsers during scans with Tosca XScan and during test execution on team agents. Install the browser extension to the browser of your choice. Google Chrome is preferred for this hands-on session.
