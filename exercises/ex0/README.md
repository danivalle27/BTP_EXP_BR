# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will prepare your environment by installing the necessary browser extensions, launcher and accessing application - System Under Test SUT - for the first time.

## Select the browsers you will use for reference, documentation, opening Tosca Cloud and the one you will open the application to be tested (SUT)

This is so scanning the application is seamless. For instance:

1- Edge for GitHub, Tosca
2- Chrome for the SUT

For this exercise, we will use this setup.

## Open the GitHub Repository on a separate browser window - Edge

This is needed to seperate the instructions from the recording. It will make life easier then.

## Install Browser Extension  (browser you are running the SUT - App to Test)

Tosca Cloud needs browser extensions to automate the following browsers during scans with Tosca XScan and during test execution on team agents. Install the browser extension to the browser of your choice. Google Chrome or Edge are preferred for this hands-on session.
